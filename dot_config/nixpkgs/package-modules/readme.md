# Package Modules
This folder is for modules of package config much like home-manager. 
After I use them for a bit I plan on adding to home-manager.
These differ from pkgsConfig as those contain my personal configuration for apps. 

These contain options to set which creates the config files. They may also just add the package to home.packages with no config to allow installing with just moduleName.enable = true to keep things consistent.
